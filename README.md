TOYFINDER
	ToyFinder is my first CLI gem project at Flatiron School. It will pull specialized toys and gadgets from funandfunction.com to aid parents and caregivers in caring for kids with special needs. When the gem is initialized, the user will be greeted with an inspirational/encouraging “Quote of the day” and presented with a list of toys/gadgets (based on specialized use) to choose from. Each option will display the specified toy and give specifics on the name, price, and further description of the product. Upon completed of the transaction, the user can exit the program.

INSTALLATION

     Install the gem:
        $ gem install toyfinder

USAGE
     From the local directory execute:
        $ toyfinder
     and follow the prompts to run the program.

DEVELOPMENT
	After checking out the repo, run bin/setup to install dependencies. Then, run rake spec to run the tests. You can also run bin/console for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
	To install this gem onto your local machine, run bundle exec rake install. To release a new version, update the version number in version.rb, and then run bundle exec rake release, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the .gem file to rubygems.org.
