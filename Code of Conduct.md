The Learn community is an open, respectful and welcoming online community of people who are committed to not just learning—but learning together. The idea of community is baked into what the product aspires to be: the most effective place online for the world to meet, to create, to exchange and to pursue mastery of knowledge.

We expect all Learners:

To be considerate, respectful, and collaborative when engaging with one another
To refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech
To consider it their duty to help lift up Learners who are struggling, to encourage them, to help them along
To contribute to improving the curriculum for the benefit of the whole world
By being committed, engaged and caring people, Learners will define the tone of the community, and will give shape to the product experience. It is our hope and expectation that Learn will be a reflection of the best in all of us.

We will not tolerate the following behaviors: harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or violent conduct. Harassment includes: offensive comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of sexual images; deliberate intimidation, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person; unwelcome sexual attention.

These behaviors are the antithesis of Learn and will be considered grounds for termination of a user’s Learn account.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Learn administrators immediately (support@learn.co).
